Data set:
4 columns- total score,skill based exp(skills score and the exp twice),total exp,uni ranking,company ranking....(age,gender)

order based on:
1.total score.
2.skill based exp.
3.total exp.
4.uni ranking.
5.company ranking.

max score for each field 10.
default is 4(if not found).

SPLIT:

FIRST PHASE:
1.existing resume details to be uploaded into database/csv.(id)(total experience,university name, company ranking,experince in usa, location)


SECOND PHASE;
1.process the existing resume with skilled experince and spacy skill extraction.
2.Score is based on skill based exp and skills scored.
3.Ranking will be based on this cumulative score^^.(first step).
??How much importance should be given to the uni ranking and company ranking??(can it be used to only seperate ppl with same cumulative score , or more imp should be given?)


Technologies to be used: Pandas dataframe.rank() or series.rank()

PREQUISITES:
1.university ranking.(rohit)
2.company ranking.(rohit)
3.change in points system for half and full scores (praneeth).
4.algorithm for score extraction(total score will be out of 10 (5 max for all skills met and 5 if experince criteria (x + 10 years) 3 if experince( x + 5) 3 if experince is (x) 1 for exp(x)

Approach:
1.We calculate on two factors.(skill based exp requirement (1 or 0) score [0-5])(if>>4 section 1)
2.if its 1 in section 1 otherwise section 2.
3.30 to uni 30 to company 40 to his overall experience.(rank them based on their skills).

Discussion:
1.Data to be saved in database.
2.Company and univerity to be directly specified by users.
3.dynamically s.e,s.c and total exp will be gathered.
4.intermediate data to be saved in csv file format.
5.job description.

WE DEFINITELY REQUIRE A JAVASCRIPT DEV WITH COMMUNICATION SKILLS.
